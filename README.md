### BreadcrumbGroup Component Overview

This is a composable, accessible breadcrumb navigation component designed according to Figma references and built with ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS.

It supports:

- Custom leading icons (e.g. folders, users)
- Vertical or slash separators (based on `leadingSeparator`)
- Per-item icons (optional)
- Tooltip for long/truncated labels
- A trailing link icon ðŸ”— aligned to the far right (not part of the breadcrumb items)
- Full accessibility with ARIA roles and keyboard navigation
- Responsive layout with consistent height (40px) and dynamic width

### Architecture & Design Decisions

- **React Component (`BreadcrumbGroup`)** is isolated inside `src/components/breadcrumb/`, making it reusable and testable.
- **Separation of Concerns:** UI primitives like `<Breadcrumb>`, `<Tooltip>`, and `<Separator>` are pulled from `@/components/ui/`, following ShadCN conventions.
- **Layout Fidelity:** The component adheres strictly to Figma specs:
  - `height: 40px`, `width: 1376px`, and internal paddings match design.
  - Custom vertical separator: `12px` wide, rotated `-90Â°`, colored `#E4E4E7`.
- **Trailing link icon** is rendered outside of the breadcrumb list and flex-aligned using `justify-between`.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Uses `role="navigation"` and `aria-label="Breadcrumb"`
  - `aria-current` for current item
  - `aria-describedby` for tooltips on truncated labels

### Storybook Stories

The following variants are available in Storybook:

- One-level, two-level, three-level breadcrumbs
- With/without leading icon
- Slash / vertical / first vertical separator
- Active, hover, focus states (visually observable via Tailwind)
- Truncated long labels with tooltips
- Trailing link icon aligned separately

All stories are grouped by category and follow consistent naming.

### Props

    label: string
